"""
This is a file for linked list data structure.
We have three types of linked lists:
- Singly linked list -- this one has just a data and one node which is a pointer to the next number,
- Doubly linked list -- this one has a data and two pointers one to the next node and the other one to the previous node.
- Circular linked list -- this one has a data and one pointer which points to the next node, but the last node points to the first node.

We always have to start from the head of the linked list.
